<h1 align="center" style=" margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Futura PT Heavy'; font-size:18pt; font-weight:600; color:#aa0000;">1</span></h1>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Why do you wear that stupid scarf when you live so close to the Compass Rose? It’s spring here, all the time,” I said, tugging on her crimson-threaded fabric. </span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Valentina Vermillion protested in the seat across from me. “It’s just special to me, Titus. It’d take too long to explain,” she muttered, sardonically scanning the onlookers. Their glances shimmered with recognition when they noticed her, and the embers in their eyes spread it like firebrands from a brush fire: soon everybody was watching us, disbelieving their favorite heroine from the Academy network programming rode before them. The streets were ragged: unpaved to code for such a fine vehicle, and the bumps shook it in shivering tremors like winters for the homeless. They looked on as if they had never seen something so beautiful, the way the rosy vermilion color saturated the chassis like a savory sour-drop: surrounded by a sea of green, brown, and extra brown, the only colors the Outwallers could afford.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Just a little bit further,” I told the driver. The car coughed smoke. The further we left the Academy the further the weather dropped, but the cold was nostalgic. There was the path I took every day to the orphanage to see her—the only walk my mother allowed me “beyond the mailbox where I can see you,” since the slanted crack of every sidewalk branded my mind like charcoal scratchings on texture.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">She was standing in the doorway, all six-feet of her hunched to almost half the height, her mopped mess of hair always damp from a one-oh-clock-bath-or-shower parted to the side with a single strand of hair hanging between her eyes, miles different from the girl who sat next to me, whose radiant, corn-silk hair carried such a brightness you could almost say it was effervescent, and I could smell its presence when she raised her arm to wave.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Sylvia muttered a faint greeting.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Valentina replied, “Hey yourself, girl, are you ready to go?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“This car’s so bright if the sun caught it wrong it would catch fire,” Sylvia said, and paused for a moment after she placed her first foot—choosing my side as if the fate of our friendship hung in the balance, the seat wide enough for three, but she pressed against me.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“It’s nice you’re with us,” Valentina said. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">Instead of all by yourself in your room,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> she inferred.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“And it’s nice to have an excuse to get out of the winter,” Sylvia said, “it’s hard to remember the last time I saw you outside the Academy, or even the last time our schedules lined up like this.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The car churned up a cough and sputtered into motion: the inertia of Sylvia’s body leaned against me with double the force.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“You probably see Titus all the time since you live a floor apart, but I only see you at training,” Valentina said, “and every other time, I see you in scrubs. So that surgeon-thing must be going well.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Taking out the broken parts and placing back the good, who knew it could ever be so hard?” Sylvia laughed. “But it’s great, finished my training for combat medic.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Pray tell, darling, I could never touch blood like that,” Valentina said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Combat-medic-archer,” I said. “So what, do you shoot medical supplies at us when we get hurt?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Sylvia pinched me.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Ouch,” I said. Then I turned to Valentina to finish the roast.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Being afraid of blood isn’t exactly an option when you’re going out to combat like the rest of us.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“It’s just that I don’t </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">prefer</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> it,” Valentina said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I laughed. “What does that mean? How can you ’</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">prefer</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">’ something else?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Sylvia said, “It’s so cold beyond the walls I’m sure their blood will freeze before it touches the ground, anyways.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I repeated, “Then what do you prefer?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Valentina blushed. “I work with knives like Sylvia. I just don’t see the clean-up,” she said, turning her glance beyond the window with a repulsion like magnets, probably just waiting until the moment that Romin could back her up, so I lightened up on her.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“You definitely have the brilliance for Reconnaissance, at least,” I said, so I could relish in her response. She turned her head even further until I mistook her for an owl. </span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Don’t take me down to your level, then try and hit on me,” she said. “You plebeians wish you could be so rich and influential like me: pray tell, it must be so, so hard. This life is literally a dream.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Really?” Sylvia and I said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">She laughed. “Not at all.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“What’s not?” a booming voice called: like a crack of thunder before his face flashed beyond the chassis. It was a first to be looking down on him.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Romin tried a step to get into the vehicle, and it felt as if we were a ship sinking stern-down, and I was glad he sat on Valentina’s side: he had a whole extra head on her and made her family’s Model-F look no larger than a toy truck.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">And then it was my </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">second</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> time I looked down on him: the chassis shifted in italics until his muscular frame bent closer to the center, and with everyone out of words, Romin opened his fat mouth to cut the silence, asking the question that was on everyone’s minds:</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“So where are we off to?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%; font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"><br /></p>
<h1 align="center" style=" margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:18pt; font-weight:600; color:#aa0000;">2</span></h1>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Tell the driver to take a left here,” I said, “even though he probably won’t want to. I know </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">he</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> knows the kind of people that live here, and it’s a whole different class from what you’re you’re used to, Valentina.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“My people!” Romin said. He pointed out every curved crimson symbol etched in the doorways. “My Brothers and Sisters of the Carmine Syndicate stretch far beyond the foothills of the Compass Rose.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The air was cold. None of the geothermal energy from the dormant volcano graced the Outwallers: the infertile, the impoverished, whose genes and lineage never brought them the fortune of a child they could train for the Academy. My luck lies in the line of my grandfather, Everett, who fought beyond the walls long before the Carmine and the king twisted the city of Blackwater into their capital city, before they installed the livid hatred of the Chymaera that’s kept our city safe for almost a hundred years. Our name reaches further in my father’s service as a Cadet. And one day, I hoped my sister would follow in my footsteps.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Just by reading the temperature of their eyes I could tell their experience with Blackwater’s far lands: the smoke saturated the sky, holding back sunshine and starlight. This city’s land wasn’t meant for life of any kind, at least beyond the warmth of hot springs and the passion of bright Cadets. Romin kept rambling about the “promise” of the Far Lands for the Carmine, and how important the powers of our essence are, how we need to preserve and not repress them like all the “</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">rich people</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">” and the “</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">man</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">” are trying to take away.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Valentina trained her glance on the floor, the only surface left that held any coat of polish, stewing a rebuttal about how essence is a waste, how persecution for using the powers of life and fire are a waste. Romin said “using those powers keeps them warm,” asking her if “she’s forgotten what temperature is living in that big house of hers,” sacrificing any chance at sex for the night over the conviction of his argument. Sylvia’s crimson eyes weighed shut from the bags under her eyes, and anytime they opened, they seemed to steal a glance at me: and I found myself returning them, too, until she rested against my shoulder like a ragdoll and I put my arm around her to keep her upright.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The smoke from the generators was so thick I couldn’t even see the ten-mile-diameter of the Compass Rose: the houses sunk in the blizzard like tiny blocks in a basin of flour until they merged with the horizon, and as I coughed and covered my mouth, I began to envy Valentina’s vermilion scarf.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">A similar signpost signified our approach. “Here it is,” I said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Here? What’s ‘here’?” Valentina said, still refusing her surroundings over the polished floor.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Our passage out,” I said, “ask your cabbie what time it is.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">She scoffed at the word ‘cabbie,’ then asked: “Charles, what time is it?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">Fuckin’ Charles,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> I thought: Romin sniggered over the name, too.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Half past three, Miss Vermillion,” Fuckin’ Charles said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“’Half past three,’ he said,” Valentina replied.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“I know, my unprivileged, plebeian ears can hear him,” I said, “that means it’s just about time.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Time for what?” Romin asked. “Is this another egress point on the Railroad?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“It’s a new one. I doubt even most of your traders know about it,” I said. “Because I’m the one that found it.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Egress point?” Valentina asked.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“A point for Frostpunks to get beyond the walls, to find things to trade,” I said, “to go off without being detected. The city is big. But they often patch the holes in the walls: the government puts moles in with the traders. But luckily it’s just my father, my sister and I, and a single shop he keeps alive as the last image of my mother.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Our boots touched the ground after Romin’s boats touched down first (I could almost hear the hydraulic sigh of relief from the Model-F). The alley was unmarked by any traders’ symbols: it was still fresh and untouched by frostpunks’ hands. The distant vibrations of the train shook the ground beneath us, a giant earthworm that would soon break the surface of the tunnel beneath us.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Sylvia’s speech slurred with prepositions: “Down there? Over the rail? On the side…” she stammered, but the tremors grew stronger. And then a shrill whistle broke the air: its pitch sinking like a slide whistle as the thunder boomed louder.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“The trains slow down aboveground,” I said, “so aim for an open car.” Valentina nodded: with her stealth training she was like a cat. Without hesitation in her spring she landed on her feet while the rest of us crumpled, and I almost laughed when Romin put a dent in the bed of the car. The sudden change in inertia flung us against the back, where we found a window to a closed-car.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I said, “This will get us past inspection. They always do a half-ass job.” If twelve-sterling-an-hour was a velocity, or if wages could be defined by speed, it’d be slower than molasses.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“As long as you know where you’re going,” Sylvia said.</span></p>

Her finished piece in the corner made me wonder how much time had passed.  Romin’s snore was loud, but only got louder with every empty handle—his throat’s static matched their </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">clank</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> with every jump of the train car. It was hard to believe that Valentina had fallen asleep, too (and a quandary how it’s possible to fall asleep </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">photogenically </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">in a train car,) hugging the script to her chest like it was her little sister.</span></p>

Men’s upper-class cloaks are </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-weight:600;">aesthetic (aesthetic in this usage is kind of a new-age slang, so I’d do something different about)</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">: at the highest class, cadets get ruby shoulder-pads, a glimmering crimson “mark” (or cape that’s shorter and far more manageable), and combat pads infused with essence. But Romin and I agree we appreciate the cut of the women’s warm-weather gear a lot better.</span></p>

And it all sounds erotic, but I couldn’t feel anything—the more I see her beauty, the sadder it makes me feel for her, and the more it brings me back to her fall. She was one of the most beautiful people I had seen: the way she blossomed after our shared childhood. Bringing her and Valentina around was the trick Romin and I used for success at parties. But the chase lost its heat after the incident . . . I told her not to drink, and I still blame myself for not being around. She started covering her body. She started eating more, then eating nothing, then eating more, than eating nothing, and started rolling down the sleeves on her wrists and wearing watches and bracelets.</span></p>

Light rolls constrict in her outfit, and sometimes I wonder if she debates between being called fat or facing the fear of being taken advantage of again. Her head dips against her shoulder. A tear floats across her face: I can hear the echoed nightmares of a distant past I saved her from before all this. BLOOD EYES! CRIMSON DEMON—but I’m not surprised kids in the orphanage could be so mean, they just didn’t learn how adults could “maturely” turn suffering inward instead of unleashing it on others. But then again, I guess Sylvia just blossomed early.</span></p>

I felt myself roll away from her warmth and sprawl across the splinters of the cabin again, my head tilted towards the sky, matching Romin’s drunken sprawl but not his snore. Strands of moonlight poured through the slats of the ceiling, tangling themselves tightly in luminous lines: the locomotive’s clouded columns scratched the strands like a bow with the thinnest frequen</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-weight:600;">cies</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> of tinnitus, reminiscent of the sound of Ellie’s strings.</span></p>

Romin might graze the clichés of numb-skull brute, but he was damn good with numbers.

The train’s shrill whistle is low-pitched and far beyond us. All that was left was sheets of virgin snow. The lack of footprints set us all in an uncomfortable ease, as if the smell of ozone would sift the air when we least anticipated it. </span></p>

Two revolvers rested in their holsters, waiting for a snap of deliverance, which made my sword and Valentina’s knives seem unnecessary, but the Academy instructors always insisted they were right: the first to show battle scars and trade war stories. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">They’ll attack you before you know it, before you can even pull the trigger or hear their clicks or their glowing eyes,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> the instructors said, </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">and you should pray you never see what they look like, those bastards, I had to kill one after he stole my fireteam-mate’s identity, and you should pray you never see them halfway through transforming, like melted flesh, like something dead-and-alive that’s half-human and half-not, and it’s…</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> incredibly effective at scaring the young Cadets. That’s why they </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-weight:600;">paid</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> Sylvia to paint posters. I guess then I was in the transition phase, or the second stage of fear like a second puberty—right before graduation when all the uncertainty and fears came back, all the “oh Gods, what’s it really like beyond the walls?” </span></p>

The ambiguous and imagined will always be far more frightening than the proven. It was like Sylvia the first week after starting medical school, when she got the “Human Book Of Known Diseases” and thumbed through it in a night like one of the government’s outlawed books about the Chosen legends—when she started believing she had all those diseases, and all I could do was laugh at her.</span></p>

And also from the crack of every branch. Romin sweat bullets as if he could use them as live ammunition, so he turned his big, bald, black head from his girlfriend. Valentina played stoic as if she were a renowned television celebrity, and Sylvia stayed close to me—I could see them all running in their minds from the concept of nighttime.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">If worst comes to worst, we could just stay out here in a house,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> I could say. Then they’d all just nervously nod their heads (or Valentina would be the first to sprint and cry for the next train), but as amusing as that would be, I decided not to bring it up.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The air grew colder with a bitter smell. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">They probably thought it was ozone.</span></p>

His hands trembled. His writing accelerated. He mumbled and cried about something he had forgotten, and eventually he got so scary my father Clint refused for me to see him: then eventually my stoic father was too terrified to see him.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">He died in his sleep,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> they said, but I know that was a lie. He stayed awake for a full month before he died—the autopsy says his brain dissolved to a tenth of its size. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">How could you tell it was the curse?</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> I asked. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">Because gray matter doesn’t glow purple,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> they said.</span></p>

If there was some magic hundred-chamber revolver and I loaded it with a single bullet, you wouldn’t let me press it against your head and pull the trigger—neither would Romin, Sylvia, or Valentina—and would you even trust I loaded just one bullet? Confirmation bias and experience is the only reason I didn’t tremble—on the first trips before my mother Moira died, Clint told me he’d protect me no matter what, and I felt so safe.</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> </span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">But the night of my mother’s death is the reason I started protecting myself, and the reason why I’ll never forgive him—if two broken pieces could always match, then maybe Sylvia and I were perfect for each other—but damaged goods didn’t fracture the same.  I always felt we were patching spaces where our imperfections failed to meet: but in time I’d learn we just failed to muster the courage to patch the space between us.</span></p>

The hinges screeched from beyond a century of snow-borne rust as chips of pine wood tore from the bottom, leaving the door with jagged, gnashing teeth. It siphoned outside air as if the house had lungs to breathe.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Hello?” I called, just to break the silence and see if I hadn’t forgotten how to speak. The house’s siding groaned in response, breathing winds into its lungs, and a single chandelier hung from the wooden cross-beam like a uvula. Dormant lanterns circled the chains as crystalline fragments shimmered—Valentina was probably glancing at them with some reminiscence of home. There were no voices outside the walls like our apartments at the Academy, footsteps from upper floors, but even in the silence, we still felt like we were being watched.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">It felt as if some agent was consuming all the light in the house, opposite of the way that light bulbs and lanterns throw their colors. Romin dragged several matches against the floor. Three sputtered in sparks before the gravity of the scene finally weighed on us, or before our terrors could even take shape, before the manifestation of an ancient bloodbath brought itself into focus: painted across the floors as if the glass of the crimson paintings had shattered under pressure and spilled their contents.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I looked at the map, then the ground, then back to the map—in the split second my fireteam felt fear’s flame feather in their lungs, my brain sputtered.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Valentina opened her mouth to scream, how much she hated blood, but the bass in Romin’s voice beat her to it.</span></p>

But that was it: his face plain and neutral as if this scene had graced him a thousand times before. “Chymaeran bastards,” he muttered several times.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">With her medical experience, Sylvia could say she owned the color red from all the cadavers she cut. Our steps clattered on the linoleum floor of the kitchen before ages-old splashes of not-ketchup flooded the floors and a sickening smell saturated the air. The bones must have been picked apart by scavengers: the meat left clean like a rib roast after a hundred starving cadets.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I threw my bag on the counter, scattering journals and notebooks and pages and artifacts—all I brought was all I inherited from my grandfather. And all across them was the same insignia, the same letter I saw etched in the doorway, the same set of strokes on the stationery that my grandfather spilled the last pieces of his mind on, the same symbol reflecting on the stone above the hearth of the fireplace, and . . .</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Valentina sunk under Romin’s arm like an afterthought as Sylvia checked the corpse: illuminated by faint beams of sunlight through the tattered shades. “I’m not trained as a mortician,” she said. “But there’s deep scratches on the vertebrae—must have been a slice to the carotid artery, and they bled out on the floor.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Romin calmly strolled across the carpet with the lantern. His fingers traced desperate scratches on the door, followed by jagged, splintered teeth around the doorknob as if someone had tried to break out: bludgeoned indentations that grew weaker and weaker. “Damn Chymaerans must have been trying to break in—the rest of the family must have been hiding in here,” he said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“But there’s no trace of Chymaeran essence along the corpse’s scratches. When Human blood and Chymaeran essence make contact, it glows purple, then leaves a dry chalk residue,” Sylvia said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“So it was Human, then?” said Valentina.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“That’s right,” I said, “Chymaeran attacks look a whole lot different.” I kept scanning through the documents and notebooks, all signed with the same cursive letter at the bottom.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“By Gods, this wasn’t Chymaeran at all, look at the marks,” she said. Tiny handprints. Like handprints of a desperate child: then the size of the clawed scratchings all made sense. The notes grew no more intelligible: further and further until I got to the bottom, to the map that sprawled across the table. And the necklace Sylvia found on the corpse had the same insignia: the letter B</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">We had been using this map for years. All the houses, all the terrain other explorers hadn’t charted, beyond the walls, beyond the eye’s reach of the train tracks, all the creases and folds that had been left to my grandfather’s memories, and all those X’es had been circling around one location: the desperation of Everett’s brainless scratchings reaching a crescendo, as if all his cerebral emotions of some long-passed moment had bled in warning. That this map wasn’t for treasure.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“This was Everett’s house,” I said, just as Romin’s kick bludgeoned the door into a shower of splinters. The rancid odor of death only grew stronger, but besides the blood of the corpse and the scratchings on the door, upturned furniture, and shattered glass all across the carpet, there was nothing else: wildlife and nature had picked the entire scene clean.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">But not the locked room, some kind of study, which held Romin and Valentina in curiosity, glowing in the dying western light as if it had been preserved so perfectly in amber. Romin asked what kind of coward would leave a child outside to die: but no corpses of children turned up in any corner of the house, no matter how hard we scanned. Our time was running short. This wasn’t a murder mystery, after all, but a Frostpunk loot run, and as the sun descended, it cast its final rays on all the reflective surfaces—metallic items, jewelry, black-font forbidden books, and the four of us loaded  sleds in haste.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Silence swept over us for nearly an hour until Romin’s voice severed it, something had been bothering him. “They weren’t protecting themselves,” he called, “it just doesn’t make sense. It had to have been something else.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“What do you mean?” Sylvia asked.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Okay,” I said.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Most days I work in ‘repo’ with the Carmine, Titus. Nobody hides anything from us or </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">me</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">,” Romin said. “Come on, this far, and we’re off with chump change?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I grumbled under my breath. “Fine.”</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The carpet folded backwards in the corner. Dusk caught one last reflection off the rectangular lid of an aluminum tin, then my fingers fondled for an edge until I lifted it from the hollowed crevice.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I shook it: something heavy inside emitted a certain curious energy, but that curiosity faded with the darkness, replaced with the anxiety of almost an hour behind. Romin ogled the box with the words </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">I told you.</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> His anticipation jumped when his huge ogre hands couldn’t tear the lock from the box, then he angrily tossed it on the sled.</span></p>

The shattered teeth of the door siphoned snowflakes: we had abused and thrown around its innards for long enough, and all that remained was a single body, whose death held no gravity—at least in the moment.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Sylvia found a fire axe in the train car. Valentina voiced her concerns it would damage the inside—but Romin was mid-swing, and all we saw was the spray of sparks illumine the box before his hands emerged from the twisted metal. The moonless night brought no radiance beyond the fire in the train car. Scraps of aged vellum lined the box, legible aged vellum, legible aged vellum and a full word at the bottom that was indiscernible in the darkness.</span></p>

Sweat soaked the front of his thin, white shirt in an upside-down triangle, despite where the dirt from his face wiped across the fabric, and it almost felt like an Academy gym.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Dad!” I shouted. “Dad, are you alright?”</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“I guess I live here then,” he laughed, dry and emptily with a sad, heaving cough to follow. “Well, you gonna lift me up, then?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Yeah, yeah,” I said.</span></p>

We sell that place, we’ll be able to keep this shop open forever.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">But he’s said that every time. It was just a “month or so” a year ago. And it was just a “year or so” two years ago. There’s an emptiness in his eyes when he looks at the picture of Moira on the wall. And how else can I tell his “habits” from earlier? Because I always find a sheet covering the portrait when he’s in the back-room with a “client,” as if her eyes could judge him from behind the frame.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“She wouldn’t want us to sell this place,” he said. “I know I don’t want to, son. You know I was gonna pass this down to you, and you’d run this business hard, and hustle, and we’d run this shop together, you and me, and Ellie could help us.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“But I’m in the Academy to finish my degree, Clint,” I said. “I’ll take care of Ellie and I’ll take care of you.”</span></p>

My glance dipped towards my feet, toes tracing the hardwood floors I crawled on as a child, and it was hard to meet his eyes, and I could tell he was having a hard time meeting mine, too.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">He grunted in either agreement, annoyance, or a little bit of both.

Toys from a decade ago sprawled across the hardwood, and I leaned toward my toes as if my weight could shear the legs straight off—if I broke the chair, Elma would make me pay for it.</span></p>

Watching the candlelight flicker on her face reminded me of her mother, in the smallest nuances of the creases in her face, and it filled me with a certain warmth.</span></p>

When you spend so much time doing work on others, sometimes you forget your own existence—and everything feels automatic, like losing sense of the heartbeat in your chest or the wind that pours in your lungs with every breath.</span></p>

I was an orphan a long time ago. So maybe the compulsion of family ties was lost on me, maybe I never was blessed with that innate connection, that feeling that comes from the subtlety of voice and mannerisms and looks that distinguish the bonds of blood, that pride resting in the soul like the flames of logs that lean against each other.</span></p>

Kids were mean. Adults were apathetic. And the only way I earned my mother and father was through my performance in pre-Academy, the luck of essence-yielding blood, and their own needs for financial support (and, of course, the opportunity to live closer to the warmth of the Compass Rose.) Sylvia earned it through hard work, too, but her blood ties to the essence were so pure that she was an anomaly: the reason why the doctors say her eyes glow bright crimson in the dark.</span></p>

Sylvia sat in her favorite chair in the corner, arms resting on the angled drafting desk with a book between her hands, but with all the commotion from lower floors, she soon gave up, stuffing a thumbnail sketch between the pages.</span></p>

Describes expeditions of this team of different races,” she said. “A heavy fantasy that takes place beyond Blackwater. A race of people with wings like angels that live in floating lands, cat-like people controlling the powers of time in this heavy, hot forest, called a ‘jungle.’ Entire fields of finely-ground rocks, and bodies of water so big that you can’t see the end of them.”</span></p>

The only religion that persists here lies in wealth, in dreams of climbing the Compass Rose. They say the whole grand mountain was a dormant volcano—and there’s a cratered lake above the clouds with water so hot you could bathe in it, with minerals so enriching your skin would emerge smoother than a newborn child’s.”</span></p>

The complex sits one of one of the Cardinal Points: giant, man-made, triangular slabs of rock that protrude from the middle of the mountain like the vanes of a compass.</span></p>

The bright glow of crimson envelops the chamber, and all of a sudden I’m consumed in fire, in flames so hot that all the water evaporates, and shouts and screams echo from off the walls. But I’m not afraid, and it doesn’t hurt me.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“I’ve had dreams of darkness, too,” I said, “but mine were of water, deep beneath the surface of an infinite lake, the faintest glow of something in the distance though I felt myself suffocate.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“The books say our people were given the gift of fire and life,” Sylvia says, her radiant glance returned by my eyes as I watched her cherry-red lips, trying to remember their succulence and the softness of her skin, and I could feel the spark of us again.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I felt myself recline against her bed as I watched her, absorbed in the fullness of her silhouette, drinking in the wholeness of her presence as if it were an elixir for my exhaustion, but an ancient sickness turned my stomach.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I felt my heart race when she turned around, between the shifting of weight on the mattress and intensity of her eyes, and I almost wished that we could be something more than the incongruences that divided us.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">She climbed on top of me, either seductively or sarcastically, her cleavage fully exposed by the cut of her dress, whispering nothings about being a healer. “With all this talk of fire, maybe I should share my heat with you,” she said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The resistance in my muscles still restrained me, that feeling of sickness and a string of words I would never forget that I wanted so badly to . . .</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“. . . Valentina got me this dress, Titus, you know why it’s my favorite?” she asked.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Why’s that,” I managed.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Because you always need someone else to take it off,” she said, her nose pressing against my cheek as I inhaled the colors of her fragrance.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I decided to act to not ruin her pleasure: “I think it’s so much better that way,” I said, an absurd feeling of guilt forcing itself to blend with my libido. I felt my hands fumble around the back of her dress, and with the last energy, I collapsed against the mattress.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">She straddled me, the weight of her body pressed on my torso as I watched her rise from my chest. She arched her back as she grinded against me, peeling her dress off as she eyed me lustfully, bearing the fruit of a feeling that I couldn’t release, so all I could do was try to hold back.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I lifted her frame onto the bed as she closed her eyes in anticipation, feeling my left arm reach under her head as my right arm embraced her. My lips pressed against her neck as she playfully moaned—though I could feel the discomfort of a long-unforgotten past surface inside her,  too.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">We were trying: trying to fill the spaces broken between us, trying to brave the soreness of a certain pain that saturated each of us, my desires opposing her fears, and her warmth opposing my bitter coldness.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">My masculine side drank in to her surrender, that surrender in her face when she gave in to my strength, the loveliness of her voice as she called for me, and I could taste the exhausting on her sweat, the sound of her heavy breathing as the only sound beyond the snow pattering against the windows, and the distant laughter of other cadets beyond the walls.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">But I couldn’t distinguish between moans and grunts in the sounds between her breaths. “Is this okay?” I asked.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">She opened her eyes softly. “You’re fine, keep going.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I continued to kiss her, feeling the curvature of the fullness of her breasts, but—”Are you sure, Sylvia?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“You’re fine, Titus,” she said. “You know I trust you.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">So as my right hand braced her shoulder, I let my left hand act on its own: she found it nestled behind her neck, my thumb caressing the side of her face as her lips pressed against mine, her teeth softly clasped around my bottom lip though I felt them chatter, as her body squirmed against me. My hand traced against the curvature of her frame until my fingers reached the fabric of her robe, causing her to flinch in protest, bashing her head against mine as I retreated.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“I—I’m sorry, I’m just not ready for that, again,” she said, “you know what . . .”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“It’s alright, I should have known,” I said. “I’m not going to force you to do anything.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I cursed myself for the relief I felt in our withdrawal. I hated that it all felt like an act. I was so drawn to her, and maybe I loved her, but the act of sharing those feelings felt like squeezing the ocean through the eye of a needle, of a gap that was still too tight.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Her fingers traced against my core, apologetically, as I wrapped my hands higher: her fingers found their way through my dense forest of hair. The coldness of my flesh contrasted the warmth of her body as she wrapped the thickness of her legs around me, like the vines that clung to the Academy suites in the summer.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">But I wouldn’t relax. And I hated myself. And my muscles were tense. And I wouldn’t give in to her. </span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“It’s okay to rest,” she said. “Let me take care of you.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“It’s alright, I can keep going,” I said, terrified, heart pounding in my chest—I wanted it so badly, but I couldn’t bring myself to ask—I felt my father speaking for me.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“You don’t have to protect me all the time,” she whispered, “just relax. Open up to me.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Open up to me.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">And then I remembered. All of it.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The smell of his breath. I could feel the tension in her legs like the hands that grasped my neck, the darkness of the room lit by a single window—the feeling of heat in my ears as if frostbite had consumed them, that feeling I felt of redness in my eyes, the poisonous scream of my lungs when I tried to shout, but there was no fuel for me to breathe—</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Open up to me, Titus!” Moira said. “You have to tell me what your father did,” she said, the blood trickling from the crown of her skull, trying to remember though it was all so fast and unbelievable, so impossible in the moment to process all those emotions like flooding a reservoir that would take lifetimes to drain through a single crack. And I looked up at my mother when I laid in her lap—her nails tracing through my hair with that look of horror—as if she could feel the approach of death before it came to her—and that bastard in the corner who wouldn’t forgive himself for the rest of his life—not until death came to take his shift at the store, and I realized I was breathing way too fast as Sylvia’s loving embrace tightened, but there wasn’t any glass shattered on the floor, no shouting from downstairs, so I let my lungs fill with her breath as if it were an elixir that could free me from that pain for a while.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">And then the sickness returned.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">A part of me wanted to shatter entirely, and I envisioned it: </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">Do you know how much it  hurt me when she died? </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The pain stung behind my eyes without tears. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">Ellie’s been so strong, I’m just so proud of her,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> I wanted to say, but I just couldn’t surrender to her, I just couldn’t give in to—</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I felt the stabbing shivers down my spine as she slid her nails against my skin. I couldn’t bring myself to believe her heart beat for me, in this moment, and so I tore myself from her, running, running, just like that night when the crimson fragments of glass shattered across the floor, the blood I saw when I descended the stairs, the intensity of her fragrance like the alcohol on my father’s breath, and her grasp draining my fullness of breath.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Gods, it felt so nice to feel the touch of her, but I was running, just like the last time I ever really cried before it was suffocated out of me.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">And then she spoke.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“I want you to know that I’m always watching you, ever since the orphanage, ever since you saved me from it, ever since you showed me that kindness, because . . .”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I braced to deflect the brunt of her words as if they could shatter me, and I left her before she could finish her sentence.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Ellie didn’t want me. Clint was fighting on his own. And the trifold pamphlet from the start of the year still sat on the counter, reading CONGRATULATIONS CADET, ENJOY YOUR STAY AT THE ACADEMY LOFTS.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">My suitcases still sat against the wall, collecting dust, filled with a whole lot of clothes I hadn’t even worn yet. The floors were pristine: the sheetless standard-issue bed without a comforter, either.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I laid on the hardwood floor. Perverse thoughts in my mind told me I didn’t deserve the comfort of the bed, so I laid there, listening to the reverberations of a party below me. A whole lot  of engineering work sat on the desk: thermal system design, kinetic properties of essence, and some other general elective I hadn’t been to all quarter.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I let time pass by for what felt like hours, until I thought my guilt would lift me from the floor and bring me back to her room to apologize, but it never came. I was bored. And I was bored of being bored, but nothing sounded interesting.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I thought about the radiant glow of the necklace enveloping my father’s shop—it wasn’t the first time that an outwaller artifact had gone off on us. In fact, it was my only proof that a god might exist, and the absurdity of those moments often blended into the dullness of my daily life, saturated in propaganda posters, in crimson-font books administered by the Ministry of Courage, and in the repetition of combat training where we were pitted against other fireteams.</span></p>

I was used to sleeping on rough surfaces after years of survival training in the Academy, training as my team’s Tactician, my team’s unofficial leader, and so I felt myself melt into the hardness of the floor, the dreams of water quickly approaching, accepting the lack of oxygen with a certain peace as that distant glow radiated, the waves on the surface lapping in bright orange, a distant scream—</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">A sound at the corner of the stairwell awoke me. Heavy footfalls cascaded against the carpet, then I turned my eyes to the clock on the wall. It was almost the afternoon of the next day. The footsteps were heavy, but not that heavy—was it Valentina, maybe? Or Sylvia? No way she’d come down here. And wait, no way it could be for me—</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">A fist pounded on the door. “Titus, Titus, open up,” a voice slurred.</span></p>

Why was he here? I heard his heavy breathing—either he took a flight of stairs too fast, or was on the verge of throwing up.</span></p>

His face swelled with bruises. Dried blood ran in two parallel lines from his nose, and he could hardly speak. “When did this happen?”</span></p>

The transgressions of a decade will never lighten their load on my heart, and I hope you understand that this box was what I had to protect. Within it is the future of the Humans: your chance at becoming the Chosen, the chance for you to follow the purest bloodline by birthright in your brother’s passing. I mourn his sacrifice in protecting you. But the future of our people lies in the strength of our connection with the Gods, by connecting with your Guardian of divine blood, and just like your father, and just like your father’s mother. You are the last blood tie that holds the Carmine blood line to the amulet, the purest bloodline passed through generations.</span></p>

I pray not for your forgiveness but for understanding. Realize the gravity of this situation before hatred decides for you. I’ve preached the details since you were a child. The knowledge of the Path resides within your mind; it cannot be taken by anyone. </span></p>

I was still in the Academy, Dragon class, just like you, all bright-eyed and excited to get out. That day, I was watching the house since my sister wasn’t there. The city guards came by, saying that Everett had sent them: it wasn’t unusual, since his storehouse was a common trade outlet he leased to government-run trade companies, so I let them in.”</span></p>

Black paint covered the gold-plated words BLESSED BE THE GODS AND THEIR PRESENCE AS GUARDIANS IN THIS WORLD, AND BLESSED BE THE CHOSEN. Two sets of marble feet stood on two different pedestals without a body to match: the words GODDESS EVELLA XCIV and CHOSEN ULLRICH XCIV hardly discernible though all the scratches.</span></p>

A short black-haired woman emerged from the doors. “He’s the reason the Chosen was killed beyond the walls! He’s doomed our people, and killed our only chance at salvation through his cowardice!”</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Guards approached from the sides, weapons drawn. Interruption of the Grandmaster General, especially with blasphemy, was a crime punishable by death—just speaking out of turn could get a cadet beaten.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“No, let’s hear her out,” the Grandmaster General said. He looked at her clothes: tattered and worn, no sign of any Academy mark or gear. “And what would you know about heroes, young lady?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“I know that heroes don’t let their nieces and nephews die,” she said, “they don’t protect themselves at the cost of childrens’ lives. Especially the child who was slated to become the next Chosen: the child of the purest blood, the son of Ullrich.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The audience scoffed. Laughter filled the halls: “Why, those are children’s tales,” the Grandmaster said. “Out of sympathy for your ignorance, I will say this once: take your delusions from this place and leave at once.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Ullrich was a legend told to rile up cadets,” another attendee shouted.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Alright, that’s enough,” the Grandmaster said. “May you all remember that great heroes like Everett show the magnitude of their significance in their opposition: the proof that they truly have made a difference against those Chymaeran sympathizers.” But my father’s words kept running through my mind. The letter stained with his blood rested in my pocket. It was a chance I couldn’t avoid.</span></p>

I ascended the marble stairs of the balcony, sliding my hands against the golden handrails that were all saturated in black paint, then passing through the balcony’s entrance arch whose damaged letters were indiscernible.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I caught a glimpse of her on the first story, escorted from the building by the officers, and I felt her name rest on the tip of my tongue, waiting to be released. I flung myself through the ballroom, down the stairs, to the outside as they approached the CITY GUARD carriage, heaving breaths between my footsteps, if I could just confirm the truth.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I struggled between choices. It felt as if my soul was tearing down the middle. The disapproving glare in Lyra’s face marked me as if I was one of the ignorant, and the guards’ glare read the same.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Last chance,” she shouted. But then all the memories of Academy life came back, the hopes of becoming a financial support for my sister, the world beyond the walls as a Dragon-class cadet—</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The guards’ sight was entirely on me: and sick of waiting, Lyra found a window. She flipped her closest captor over her shoulder, unsnapping the revolver from his waist as she flicked the chamber.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">Blam.</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> Crimson gore erupted from the guard’s chest: before he could react, she primed the hammer again. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">Blam.</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> Gray matter sprayed across the cobblestone walk as another guard collapsed to the ground, saturated in the horrified face of the third officer. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">Click. Blam. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The officer was holding his chest: the wetness spread across his chest as a single streak descended his shirt, then she turned to me, and hesitated for a moment—</span></p>

She crumpled to the ground. Four large pools of red sifted between the cracks of cobblestone, and I dashed to lift the gut-shot guard from the ground, taking his arm upon my shoulder, administering whatever lasting remnants of Sylvia’s surgical small-talk could help me, placing pressure on the wound, shouting for medical attention, or anyone, feeling the warm blood of the victims trickle down my face.</span></p>

Children played in the lawns on the sides of the mountains while mothers and fathers stoked fire pits, wearing nothing but short sleeves and shorts. The second tier was halfway to the wall of blizzarding conditions: mixed incandescents and flickering flames in the windowsills, crunched complexes where many lived close together. Then the third died out in weak, distant flames, saturated in snow, thatch metal roofing saturated with a foot of fresh powder. The fourth district wasn’t even a district: it was completely dark.</span></p>

Blood. Flesh. The images burned a hole through my heart like acid, leaving a certain emptiness within me. When I felt her soft skin graze me, I felt a spark of something I had been missing for a long time, something that eluded me, something that I patiently deferred for the longest time.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“But at least I’m off for the night,” she said. “I heard about your heroics the other day, helping save an officer’s life.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I remembered my cowardice in hesitation. I couldn’t shake it. “Yeah, I just did what I could,” I said, feeling some force draw me closer to her, just to feel our skin touch again.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“What are you doing tonight? Quite the coincidence I ran into you here,” said Isla. Her Dragon mark fluttered behind her back. “Most of the time I’m seeing you in matches.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Yeah, and most of the time, it’s us looking up at you,” I said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">She returned another unrequited laugh. “Well, it’s impressive enough for both of us to be at the top.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Sure is,” I said, and I could clearly see the end of this conversation—we were a little over halfway to the bottom. Sylvia’s eyes flashed in my mind, the feeling of her skin, the softness of her, a feeling of regret for something I hadn’t done yet, trying to calculate the weight of my decision. </span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“What are you doing tonight?” Isla asked.</span></p>

The warmth of her skin felt so nice in contrast, and I couldn’t resist thinking of what was beyond Sylvia’s barriers, as much as I hated it, it had been so long, and with all the pain, I just . . .</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I said, “I gotta take care of my sister.”</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Her skin looked so soft, and . . . “Sure,” I said, “sounds great. Well, I guess you know where to find me.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“At your old house, or studying the rest of the time in the Grand Library. But reading more books isn’t gonna make beating us any easier, Tie,” Isla replied.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I felt the tram car click at the bottom of the rails. She waved good-bye to me, and I waved back, a strange sense of integrity mixing with the hollowness of the faces and the exhaustion of the loneliness as I set out for my sister.</span></p>

I was originally the one that named it </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">Wolfie</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">, and she was so excited when I handed it down to her that she felt like she just had to keep its name the same.</span></p>

The Owl, the Cardinal, and all the other birds were off getting drunk somewhere—neither even bothered to leave Ellie any food or water, so she was starving when I got back, saying she was gonna take some money from Auntie’s purse and head down to the corner store (though I caught her just in time, she was probably bluffing.)</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“That’s good,” I said—probably the postman, since we’re among the furthest houses in the district. “You get to sleep, now, so you can wake up for Seminary tomorrow, okay?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Okay, Tie,” she said.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I lightly closed the door of her room after shutting the window, the last crack of electric light sputtering through the crack, reflecting off her flaxen hair until the strip vanished and her gentle breaths filled the room. My childhood bedroom was down the hall: door still open, a single candle illuminating the room in flickering light (because we couldn’t afford electricity </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">every</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">where), though the darkness was deceiving. Auntie Cardinal turned it into a closet. Boxes piled all across the floor, filled with her sewing works and anything else she could jam in there, but the boxes of wool were soft enough that I could make a bed, so long as Auntie didn’t catch me in the morning, or else she’d spill some insulting complaint on why </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">my father just had to adopt me, since zero was enough in the first place,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> and I’d just smile and nod or apologize profusely.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">One of the books from the expedition was turned over like a hardcover bridge between the boxes, and I lifted it: </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">The Phantom Absolution,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> a black-text fiction piece on heroes journeying beyond the wall, the same book that Sylvia was reading earlier. A group of heroes from different races: the Ahkvasans, cat-people controlling the speed of time. Some race that controlled lightning. Another that controlled death. The Humans. A race of winged angels in floating lands, controlling the power of the mind, and plant-beings, and all these other creatures, so interesting, though all I could distinguish was the pictures since I couldn’t read the language.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The hand-drawn images engrossed me until I heard a knock at the door, and my thoughts instantly raced to the men that Ellie had been talking about earlier, and they sounded louder and louder, so in fear of waking Ellie, I ran down the stairs to check: quick, light footsteps as I placed my weight against the railing, allowing my footsteps to depress into the carpet.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">They hadn’t heard me. The knocking continued. I looked through the eye-hole, though through the darkness, the figure was indiscernible. I slowly peered though the window, my heart racing, seeing nothing but the pitch darkness of light until a sudden flash of red terrified me, and I collapsed backwards before I could distinguish what it was.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Several breaths later, I returned to the door (quietly (enough, I think)), twisting the handle and the lock. “You scared me,” I whispered. “But what brings you here so late?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Another episode right now.” I could see the tears streaming from her crimson eyes, though she tried to stop them. “I just need a friend right now. And I know—I know what happened the other night, I just need you, or Romin, or Valentina, but I really need you right now,” she muttered, as her words tapered off into ramblings, though the emotion behind them was all I could hear.  We could empathize with each other; two survivors cut from the same cloth that patched each other up, two people that could genuinely understand the same type of pain. So I led her by hand to the couch in the family room, cluttered with boxes, just like every other room in this house that the Cardinal had disgraced.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">My arms extended around her. My left hand found its way behind her head, and my right hand embraced her side as I traced my fingers though her hair, whispering with a calming </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">shhhhhh </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">intonation like the sound of water, not keeping her from crying, but just being present enough for her to feel it out with someone.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">It’s like I just can’t feel,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> she’d always explain. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">Like I can’t let it out and I’m just here,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> she’d say,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;"> and sometimes I feel like I just want to die, I just can’t feel it, and then I wonder if I’ve always been this way, if I’ve ever felt it,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> and then I embrace her, because no series of words ever spoke so accurately for my own pain, though instead, I so often turned it internally.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I felt the release of my own pain within me, the imagination of its release reflected in watching her, and I imagined the roles had been reversed, what it would feel like, though all I felt was this deep-seated need to protect her. “I’m not going anywhere,” I said, “and I’ll stay as long as you need me to, until you feel better.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“But will I?” she asked, “I just . . .”</span></p>

People like us just have to look out for each other, that’s the only way we can survive.”</span></p>

W-when you left me like that, that look in your eyes, I . . . I’m sorry if it wasn’t good enough for you, I’m just not good enough, I’m sorry, I . . .” She trailed off, her sobs turning to heaving cries as I traced my nails against her back, tightening my grip against her as she melted into me.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“There you go, there you go, Sylvia. I’m not going anywhere, I’m right here,” I said, as the snow pattered against the windows, as the moonlight engulfed the two of us, my head resting above her as her sobs faded out, growing heavier and heavier with the weight of exhaustion, waiting for hours as she faded out onto the edge of sleep, and I wrapped her in a blanket, resting her head against a pillow, tracing the hair from her face and planting a kiss on her cheek. The voices and thoughts didn’t catch me: I was protecting her, after all. All she needed was some sleep and some touch. Maybe in the morning she would feel better—it was always a game of probability with this curse: both for me, and for her.</span></p>

I collapsed on the clouds of wool, blissfully unaware of anything beyond the onset of sleep as my eyes weighed shut, dreaming of water and glowing lights, just as Sylvia had recurring dreams of fire.</span></p>

The Cardinal hated when we ‘wasted’ her food, as if hoarding jars of canned fruit and beans would add another year to her life in the apocalypse.</span></p>
