	  	  <h2 class="FBC_h2">Prologue</h2>
			<p>The skyline was beautiful on fire. And it was far too easy to forget the sky stretched above us: behind the city walls, generators coughed so much smoke in the face of the Gods I figured our frozen climate came in punishment.</p>
<p>Sylvia leaned against the slats of the train car. Her hair’s entanglement in the splinters suspended her like a marionette from dark threads as she leaned over her work. The fine instruments from her toolkit scattered across the top of a box, along with a full satchel of what others would call trash: forks, spoons, metal scrap, and twine.</p>
<p>My head rested to the side of her, and my jet-black beard bristled against the splinters in the wooden floorboards. Her leg was marked with several scars: slashes I only saw in their entirely whenever we tried at intimacy, and anytime I saw them, it only served to remind me of the pain the orphanage caused her.</p>
<p>“Where’d you get the junk this time?” I asked.</p>
<p>“It’s not junk,” she said. It was fun to tease her now and then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I replied, “But you make it look so beautiful.”</p>
<p>Her eyes steadied on the severed end of a metal spoon. The tiny mallet drove against it with a swift <em>whack</em>, bending the handle around a necklace string in the shape of a heart. The words LOVE and PEACE embossed in the iron in crimson lettering.</p>
<p>“Just shows you damaged goods don’t have to have a shelf life,” she said. “Imperfections in the steel don’t go away. But you can make those fractures a smaller part of it, if you really try.” She branded her name into the back of it – just a first name, that was all she had. I could still hear the echoed nightmare of the names the children crafted for her, from a past I fought to save her from: BLOOD EYES. CRIMSON DEMON.</p>
<p>The screeching contact of steel-on-steel spat sparks beneath the chassis. The distant hum of the engine was high and light, setting me on the edge of slumber. I knew I had to stay awake. The punishment for desertion was worse than death, and as a Frostpunk who scoured far beyond the walls for artifacts to sell, my eyes hinged open with fear and instinct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I let them float across the cabin to another person still awake. Valentina Vermillion scanned the script of the city’s next major production titled <em>Fear the Chymaera</em>, written in crimson cursive on the front of the manuscript. Her clothes were so new, clean, and white, it made me wonder what happened to her immaculate outfits after she wore them once or twice (besides that tattered red scarf, and the same hat that always rested atop her head.) Beneath her gaze, the hulking mass of dark flesh she loved called Romin sprawled with his head face down in her lap, his bag still strapped around his shoulders, clanking with each crack in the rail lines. And from the sound, I knew his bottles were empty.</p>
<p>My head tilted towards the sky, matching Romin’s drunken sprawl, but not his snore. Strands of dusk poured through the slats of the ceiling, tangling themselves tightly in luminous lines: the locomotive’s clouded columns scratched the strands like a bow, reminding me of the softness of my little sister Ellie’s strings. Since we left, all I could think of were the last words I spoke to her hours ago, standing in the entryway of my childhood home before leaving.</p>
<p>“I’m off beyond the walls again,” I told her. “Father needs more goods for the surplus store.”</p>
<p>“When will he come back? I haven’t seen him in days,” Ellie said. “He’s almost worse than Mommy.”</p>
<p>The words hit me like a runaway carriage. Mom was dead. Our father was alive, but so distant – still obsessed with that shop since it held the last memories of her, in a picture he drank to every night somewhere tucked behind the counter.</p>
<p>“He won’t be back tonight, little bug,” I said. “But I’ll be back tomorrow morning to wake you up for school. I’m sorry. Our family needs money. It’s for our own good, and it’s for your education.”</p>
<p>She balled her hands into fists until nails bit her flesh. “Why not tonight? Why does everyone hate me?” she asked. “Why doesn’t daddy come home? Why do you leave me?” The emptiness in her gaze stretched on with a thousand-yard stare; not in my eyes, but somewhere far beyond, as if the afterlife was a place just past our focus. Maybe it was between us. I wished she could feel the warmth of my embrace when I hugged her, but her heart was hypothermic. All I ever wanted was to give her something close to the life I had before my mother died: she passed several years after she was born. She was far too young to even remember her own mother’s face: and not seeing her father maybe made her wonder if she was born at all.</p>
<p>“I love you, Ellie,” I said, over and over like a mantra, tightening my arms around her as my hand held the back of her head to my shoulder, knowing empty words would never suffice. The only lessons this world taught me were of inequality and brutality – shaping an ideal world for her was no easier than sculpting water.</p>
<p>“I know,” she said. And maybe that was all father and I ever deserved.</p>
<p>“Titus. Titus . . . Titus!” Valentina said. The smell of ozone was growing stronger – and the Blackwater Military Academy always warned it was a sign of the Chymaera. The trees glowed amethyst beyond the slats, getting brighter and brighter</p>
<p>I reassured her, “It’s fine, Val,” but her hands trembled, “you know, I’ve never seen one before. Remember, I’ve been doing this for years.” I wasn’t surprised her wealth blinded her: fifteen years of our camaraderie as a Fireteam in the Academy was the only reason all three of them joined me out here. That, and the burning curiosity only quenched for an unlucky handful of citizens. No wealth could ever quench that curiosity. Not for Valentina. And not for Romin, either. It was the poor like me whose poverty forced us out here to scour artifacts in the wastelands. Who else would sacrifice their life beyond the walls of the last capital of the Humans?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The train arrives in Blackwater at twelve ‘o clock,” Romin said. “If it takes us two hours to get out this far, we’ll have to be back here by ten. Time is money, and the shipping records from the Carmine warehouse are infallible – so show us what you do, Titus.”</p>
<p>Romin might graze the clichés of numb-skull, bald-head brute, but he was so damn good with numbers. As the Son of the Carmine, a clan representing a fifth of the city of Blackwater, he was slated to take a position of leadership after his parents disappeared a long time ago.</p>
<p>Valentina still had snow still stuffed in her hat from the jump, but she refused to remove it. Instead, she checked the weapons installed across her body – we looked like dough-rollers fresh out of the kitchen, dusted by sheets of flour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sylvia shook the ice crystals from her eyelashes before she examined the map. “Due north and east,” she shouted, steadying the quiver on her shoulder as she took the bow in her hand.</p>
<p>I said, “The train snakes along the ridge until it reaches the cliff -- the line right here,” rubbing my hands together before tracing the map with my finger. I breathed in my palms. “The edge of discovery keeps getting further and further – ten years, and it already takes two hours to get anywhere the other Frostpunks haven’t been.” My grandfather’s map had X’es scrawled across it, the only intelligible mark beyond the scribbled ramblings from his dementia.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s nice to help the poor every so often,” Valentina said, dusting off her coat.</p>
<p>“I’m just thankful for your patronage, ma’am,” I said. “Give me papers later and I’ll sign off on your privilege license.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have all day,” she replied. “Do you practice your handwriting enough to write legibly?”</p>
<p>“It’ll be quick. Don’t want you to miss the money-burning party, where you get to eat caviar and complain about how warm it is in your house,” I replied.</p>
<p>“Do you really do that?” Romin asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, of course,” Valentina said. “Poor Carmine, it must be so lonely and cold down at the base of the mountain. Who needs geothermal heat when you have money to burn?”</p>
<p>“Then you won’t even fathom how it feels for me,” I said.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not my fault you don’t sleep at your Academy loft,” Valentina replied. “Your sister’s cute, though. I can’t blame you for seeing her so much.”</p>
<p>“She just deserves a better childhood than I had,” I said. Sylvia nodded in agreement—maybe she stirred through several memories. The train’s shrill whistle was low-pitched and far beyond us, and all that remained was sheets of virgin snow. The lack of footprints set us all in an uncomfortable ease, as if the smell of ozone would sift the air again when we least anticipated it.</p>
<p>Romin’s hands froze at attention, sweating bullets as if he could use them as ammunition. Two revolvers rested in his holsters, waiting for a snap of deliverance, which made my sword and Valentina’s knives seem unnecessary, but the Academy instructors always insisted they were needed. They’ll attack you before you know it, before you can even pull the trigger or hear their clicks or their glowing eyes, the survivors said, and you should pray you never see what they look like, those bastards, I had to kill one after he stole my fireteam-mate’s identity, and you should pray you never see them halfway through transforming, like melted flesh, like something dead-and-alive that’s half-human and half-not, and it’s… incredibly effective at scaring the young Cadets. That’s why they paid Sylvia to paint posters. I guess then I was in the transition phase, or the second stage of fear like a second puberty—right before graduation when all the uncertainty and fears came back, all the “oh, Gods, what’s it really like beyond the walls?”</p>
<p>They didn’t show us for a reason. &nbsp;Anything ambiguous and imagined will always frighten more than what’s learned and proven. It was like Sylvia the first week after starting medical training, when she got the “Human Book of Known Diseases” and thumbed through it in a night – afraid neck-strain and a headache meant she had every disease in the book.</p>
<p>The walk was quiet since quiet was so rare. Valentina mouthed her lines, and Sylvia stayed close to me—I could see them all running in their minds from the concept of nighttime out here.</p>
<p>“If worst comes to worst, we can just stay out here in a house,” I said. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I thumbed through Everett’s old records, mostly flooded with indiscernible scribbles and disjointed words—a single crest consistent across all of them with our family name: <em>Berguard.</em>&nbsp; I was young when he approached the end of his life, when the ability to sleep was stolen from him by the Chymaeran Curse. His hands trembled. His writing accelerated. He mumbled and cried about something he had forgotten, and eventually he lost so much of his humanity my father Clint refused for me to see him. And after time, even my stoic father was too afraid of him.</p>
<p>He died in his sleep, they said, but I know that was a lie. He stayed awake for a full month before he died—the autopsy says his brain dissolved to a tenth of its size. How could you tell it was the curse? I asked. Because gray matter doesn’t glow purple, they said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>The door took a full shoulder before it gave in. The hinges screeched from beyond a century of snow-borne rust as chips of pine wood tore from the bottom, leaving the door with jagged, gnashing teeth. It siphoned outside air as if the house had lungs to breathe.</p>
<p>I called a greeting as if someone could answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good. I hadn’t forgotten how to speak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The house’s siding groaned in response, breathing winds into its lungs, and a single chandelier hung from the wooden cross-beam like a uvula. Dormant lanterns circled the chains as crystalline fragments shimmered—Valentina was probably glancing at them with some reminiscence of home. There were no voices outside the walls like our apartments at the Academy, footsteps from upper floors, but even in the silence, we still felt like we were being watched.</p>
<p>It felt as if some agent was consuming all the light in the house, opposite of the way that light bulbs and lanterns throw their colors. Romin dragged several matches against the floor. Three sputtered in sparks before the gravity of the scene finally weighed on us, or before our terrors could even take shape, before the manifestation of an ancient bloodbath brought itself into focus: painted across the floors as if the glass of the crimson paintings had shattered under pressure and spilled their contents.</p>
<p>I looked at the map, then the ground, then back to the map—in the split second my fireteam felt fear’s flame feather in their lungs, my brain sputtered.</p>
<p>Valentina opened her mouth to scream, how much she hated blood, but the bass in Romin’s voice beat her to it. They found the corpse’s thoughts spread across the wall before they saw the body.</p>
<p>“Gods,” he said. But that was it: his face plain and neutral as if this scene had graced him a thousand times before. “Chymaeran bastards,” he muttered several times.</p>
<p>With her medical experience, Sylvia could say she owned the color red. Our steps clattered on the linoleum floor of the kitchen before ages-old splashes of not-ketchup flooded the floors and a sickening smell saturated the air. The bones must have been picked apart by scavengers: the meat left clean like an Academy rib roast after a hundred starving cadets.</p>
<p>My bag landed on the counter. Journals and notebooks and pages and artifacts scattered out—the things I inherited from my grandfather, and all across them was the same insignia, the same letter I saw etched in the doorway, the same set of strokes on the stationery that my grandfather spilled the last pieces of his mind on, the same symbol reflecting on the stone above the hearth of the fireplace, and . . .</p>
<p>Valentina sunk under Romin’s arm like an afterthought as Sylvia checked the corpse: illuminated by faint beams of sunlight through the tattered shades. “I’m not a mortician,” she said, “but there’s deep scratches on the vertebrae—must have been a slice to the carotid artery, then they bled out on the floor.”</p>
<p>Romin strolled across the carpet with the lantern. His fingers traced desperate scratches on the door, followed by jagged, splintered teeth around the doorknob as if someone had tried to break out: bludgeoned indentations that grew weaker and weaker. “Damn Chymaerans must have been trying to break in—the rest of the family must have been hiding in here,” he said.</p>
<p>“But there’s no trace of Chymaeran essence along the corpse’s scratches. When Human blood and Chymaeran essence make contact, it glows purple, then leaves a dry chalk residue,” Sylvia said.</p>
<p>“So it was Human, then,” Valentina said.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” I said, “Chymaeran attacks look a whole lot different.” I kept scanning through the documents and notebooks, all signed with the same cursive letter at the bottom.</p>
<p>“Wait, no. No . . . by Gods, this wasn’t Chymaeran at all,” she said, “look at the marks.” Tiny handprints. Like handprints of a desperate child: then the size of the clawed scratchings all made sense. The notes grew no more intelligible: further and further until I got to the bottom, to the map that sprawled across the table. And the necklace Sylvia found on the corpse had the same insignia: the letter B.</p>
<p>We had been using this map for years. All the houses, all the terrain other explorers hadn’t charted, beyond the walls, beyond the eye’s reach of the train tracks, all the creases and folds that had been left to my grandfather’s memories, and all those X’es had been circling around one location: the desperation of Everett’s brainless scratchings reaching a crescendo, as if all his cerebral emotions of some long-passed moment had bled in warning. That this map wasn’t for treasure.</p>
<p>“This was Everett’s house,” I said, just as Romin’s kick bludgeoned the door into a shower of splinters. The rancid odor of death only grew stronger, but besides the blood of the corpse and the scratchings on the door, upturned furniture, and shattered glass all across the carpet, there was nothing else: wildlife and nature had picked the entire scene clean.</p>
<p>But not the locked room, some kind of study, which held Romin and Valentina in curiosity, glowing in the dying western light as if it had been preserved so perfectly in amber. Romin asked what kind of coward would leave a child outside to die. Our time was running short. This wasn’t a murder mystery, after all, but a Frostpunk loot run, and as the sun descended, it cast its final rays on all the reflective surfaces—metallic items, jewelry, black-font forbidden books, and the four of us loaded sleds in haste. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>[END OF CLASS READING]</strong></p>
<p>Silence swept over us for minutes until Romin’s voice severed it, something had been bothering him. “They weren’t protecting themselves,” he called, “it just doesn’t make sense. It had to have been something else.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Sylvia asked.</p>
<p>“Un-shattered glass in the study, the windows still intact, all locked in the down position—you see this door locks from the inside, and it was locked.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said.</p>
<p>“So if the door was locked, why did that coward stay in the room? And let those kids die from whatever was on the other side of the door? They were children. Children.” He began to fervently scan the study, but the sun was setting, already past the pine trees, setting the entire room in a fading afterglow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have to get home,” I said.</p>
<p>“Not quite yet,” Romin said. “Most days I work ‘repo’ with the Carmine, and nobody hides anything from us.” He punched my shoulder lightly, though it almost threw me against the wall. “Come on, this far, and we’re off with chump change? Do you really give up this easy when you’re on the job?”</p>
<p>I grumbled under my breath. “Fine, then. What’s your expert opinion?”</p>
<p>“Check where the walls meet the carpet,” Romin said, “just look. I’ve done this so much I can practically feel it,”</p>
<p>“Ridiculous,” I said, “we’re wasting daylight, there’s not a…” The carpet folded backwards in the corner. Dusk caught one last reflection off the rectangular lid of an aluminum tin, then my fingers fondled for an edge until I lifted it from the hollowed crevice.</p>
<p>I shook it: something heavy inside emitted a curious energy, but that curiosity faded with the darkness, replaced with the anxiety of us almost an hour behind schedule. Romin ogled the box with the words <em>I told you</em> locked in his lips. His anticipation jumped when his huge ogre hands couldn’t tear the lock from the box, then he angrily tossed it on the sled.</p>
<p>It was past time to head back. I tossed a final look over my shoulder. The shattered teeth of the door sucked in snowflakes: we had abused and thrown around its innards for long enough, and all that remained was a single body, whose death held no gravity—at least in the moment.</p>
<p>Sylvia found a fire axe in the train car. Valentina voiced her concerns it would damage the inside—but Romin was mid-swing, and all we saw was the spray of sparks illumine the box before his hands emerged from the twisted metal. The moonless night brought no radiance beyond the fire in the train car. Scraps of aged vellum lined the box, legible aged vellum, legible aged vellum and a full word at the bottom that was indiscernible in the darkness.</p>
<p>Romin’s hands held two strands of sliver that swung with the weight of a pendant. It glowed the faintest crimson, and it was in that moment I should have known the significance of the artifact that sat for decades waiting to reach my hands.</p>
