					<h1 align="center" style=" margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Futura PT Heavy'; font-size:18pt; font-weight:600; color:#aa0000;">1</span></h1>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Why do you wear that stupid scarf when you live so close to the Compass Rose? It’s spring here, all the time,” I said, tugging on her crimson-threaded fabric. </span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Valentina Vermillion protested in the seat across from me. “It’s just special to me, Titus. It’d take too long to explain,” she muttered, sardonically scanning the onlookers. Their glances shimmered with recognition when they noticed her, and the embers in their eyes spread it like firebrands from a brush fire: soon everybody was watching us, disbelieving their favorite heroine from the Academy network programming rode before them. The streets were ragged: unpaved to code for such a fine vehicle, and the bumps shook it in shivering tremors like winters for the homeless. They looked on as if they had never seen something so beautiful, the way the rosy vermilion color saturated the chassis like a savory sour-drop: surrounded by a sea of green, brown, and extra brown, the only colors the Outwallers could afford.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Just a little bit further,” I told the driver. The car coughed smoke. The further we left the Academy the further the weather dropped, but the cold was nostalgic. There was the path I took every day to the orphanage to see her—the only walk my mother allowed me “beyond the mailbox where I can see you,” since the slanted crack of every sidewalk branded my mind like charcoal scratchings on texture.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">She was standing in the doorway, all six-feet of her hunched to almost half the height, her mopped mess of hair always damp from a one-oh-clock-bath-or-shower parted to the side with a single strand of hair hanging between her eyes, miles different from the girl who sat next to me, whose radiant, corn-silk hair carried such a brightness you could almost say it was effervescent, and I could smell its presence when she raised her arm to wave.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Sylvia muttered a faint greeting.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Valentina replied, “Hey yourself, girl, are you ready to go?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“This car’s so bright if the sun caught it wrong it would catch fire,” Sylvia said, and paused for a moment after she placed her first foot—choosing my side as if the fate of our friendship hung in the balance, the seat wide enough for three, but she pressed against me.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“It’s nice you’re with us,” Valentina said. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">Instead of all by yourself in your room,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> she inferred.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“And it’s nice to have an excuse to get out of the winter,” Sylvia said, “it’s hard to remember the last time I saw you outside the Academy, or even the last time our schedules lined up like this.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The car churned up a cough and sputtered into motion: the inertia of Sylvia’s body leaned against me with double the force.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“You probably see Titus all the time since you live a floor apart, but I only see you at training,” Valentina said, “and every other time, I see you in scrubs. So that surgeon-thing must be going well.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Taking out the broken parts and placing back the good, who knew it could ever be so hard?” Sylvia laughed. “But it’s great, finished my training for combat medic.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Pray tell, darling, I could never touch blood like that,” Valentina said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Combat-medic-archer,” I said. “So what, do you shoot medical supplies at us when we get hurt?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Sylvia pinched me.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Ouch,” I said. Then I turned to Valentina to finish the roast.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Being afraid of blood isn’t exactly an option when you’re going out to combat like the rest of us.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“It’s just that I don’t </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">prefer</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> it,” Valentina said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I laughed. “What does that mean? How can you ’</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">prefer</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">’ something else?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Sylvia said, “It’s so cold beyond the walls I’m sure their blood will freeze before it touches the ground, anyways.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I repeated, “Then what do you prefer?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Valentina blushed. “I work with knives like Sylvia. I just don’t see the clean-up,” she said, turning her glance beyond the window with a repulsion like magnets, probably just waiting until the moment that Romin could back her up, so I lightened up on her.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“You definitely have the brilliance for Reconnaissance, at least,” I said, so I could relish in her response. She turned her head even further until I mistook her for an owl. </span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Don’t take me down to your level, then try and hit on me,” she said. “You plebeians wish you could be so rich and influential like me: pray tell, it must be so, so hard. This life is literally a dream.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Really?” Sylvia and I said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">She laughed. “Not at all.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“What’s not?” a booming voice called: like a crack of thunder before his face flashed beyond the chassis. It was a first to be looking down on him.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Romin tried a step to get into the vehicle, and it felt as if we were a ship sinking stern-down, and I was glad he sat on Valentina’s side: he had a whole extra head on her and made her family’s Model-F look no larger than a toy truck.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">And then it was my </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">second</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> time I looked down on him: the chassis shifted in italics until his muscular frame bent closer to the center, and with everyone out of words, Romin opened his fat mouth to cut the silence, asking the question that was on everyone’s minds:</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“So where are we off to?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%; font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"><br /></p>
<h1 align="center" style=" margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:18pt; font-weight:600; color:#aa0000;">2</span></h1>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Tell the driver to take a left here,” I said, “even though he probably won’t want to. I know </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">he</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> knows the kind of people that live here, and it’s a whole different class from what you’re you’re used to, Valentina.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“My people!” Romin said. He pointed out every curved crimson symbol etched in the doorways. “My Brothers and Sisters of the Carmine Syndicate stretch far beyond the foothills of the Compass Rose.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The air was cold. None of the geothermal energy from the dormant volcano graced the Outwallers: the infertile, the impoverished, whose genes and lineage never brought them the fortune of a child they could train for the Academy. My luck lies in the line of my grandfather, Everett, who fought beyond the walls long before the Carmine and the king twisted the city of Blackwater into their capital city, before they installed the livid hatred of the Chymaera that’s kept our city safe for almost a hundred years. Our name reaches further in my father’s service as a Cadet. And one day, I hoped my sister would follow in my footsteps.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Just by reading the temperature of their eyes I could tell their experience with Blackwater’s far lands: the smoke saturated the sky, holding back sunshine and starlight. This city’s land wasn’t meant for life of any kind, at least beyond the warmth of hot springs and the passion of bright Cadets. Romin kept rambling about the “promise” of the Far Lands for the Carmine, and how important the powers of our essence are, how we need to preserve and not repress them like all the “</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">rich people</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">” and the “</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">man</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">” are trying to take away.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Valentina trained her glance on the floor, the only surface left that held any coat of polish, stewing a rebuttal about how essence is a waste, how persecution for using the powers of life and fire are a waste. Romin said “using those powers keeps them warm,” asking her if “she’s forgotten what temperature is living in that big house of hers,” sacrificing any chance at sex for the night over the conviction of his argument. Sylvia’s crimson eyes weighed shut from the bags under her eyes, and anytime they opened, they seemed to steal a glance at me: and I found myself returning them, too, until she rested against my shoulder like a ragdoll and I put my arm around her to keep her upright.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The smoke from the generators was so thick I couldn’t even see the ten-mile-diameter of the Compass Rose: the houses sunk in the blizzard like tiny blocks in a basin of flour until they merged with the horizon, and as I coughed and covered my mouth, I began to envy Valentina’s vermilion scarf.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">A similar signpost signified our approach. “Here it is,” I said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Here? What’s ‘here’?” Valentina said, still refusing her surroundings over the polished floor.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Our passage out,” I said, “ask your cabbie what time it is.”</span></p>

And Romin clinked through the bottles in his bag: his hobby was being an alcoholic since the effects never seemed to reach him, and it helped him forget about his brother. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-weight:600;">And maybe it helped him forget about his brother.

Her finished piece in the corner made me wonder how much time had passed.  Romin’s snore was loud, but only got louder with every empty handle—his throat’s static matched their </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">clank</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> with every jump of the train car. It was hard to believe that Valentina had fallen asleep, too (and a quandary how it’s possible to fall asleep </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">photogenically </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">in a train car,) hugging the script to her chest like it was her little sister.</span></p>

Men’s upper-class cloaks are </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-weight:600;">aesthetic (aesthetic in this usage is kind of a new-age slang, so I’d do something different about)</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">: at the highest class, cadets get ruby shoulder-pads, a glimmering crimson “mark” (or cape that’s shorter and far more manageable), and combat pads infused with essence.

And it all sounds erotic, but I couldn’t feel anything—the more I see her beauty, the sadder it makes me feel for her, and the more it brings me back to her fall. She was one of the most beautiful people I had seen: the way she blossomed after our shared childhood. Bringing her and Valentina around was the trick Romin and I used for success at parties. But the chase lost its heat after the incident . . . I told her not to drink, and I still blame myself for not being around. She started covering her body. She started eating more, then eating nothing, then eating more, than eating nothing, and started rolling down the sleeves on her wrists and wearing watches and bracelets.</span></p>

Light rolls constrict in her outfit, and sometimes I wonder if she debates between being called fat or facing the fear of being taken advantage of again. Her head dips against her shoulder. A tear floats across her face: I can hear the echoed nightmares of a distant past I saved her from before all this. BLOOD EYES! CRIMSON DEMON—but I’m not surprised kids in the orphanage could be so mean, they just didn’t learn how adults could “maturely” turn suffering inward instead of unleashing it on others. But then again, I guess Sylvia just blossomed early.</span></p>

I felt myself roll away from her warmth and sprawl across the splinters of the cabin again, my head tilted towards the sky, matching Romin’s drunken sprawl but not his snore. Strands of moonlight poured through the slats of the ceiling, tangling themselves tightly in luminous lines: the locomotive’s clouded columns scratched the strands like a bow with the thinnest frequen</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-weight:600;">cies</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> of tinnitus, reminiscent of the sound of Ellie’s strings.</span></p>

Romin might graze the clichés of numb-skull brute, but he was damn good with numbers.

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Fair enough, Titus, let’s get this over with, then,” she replied. “If I’m not back on time I’ll miss the money-burning party, then I won’t get to eat caviar and complain about the warm weather.” </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-weight:600;">(Have Titus say this to her. A cheeky back and forth)</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Do you really do that?” Romin asked.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Oh, of course,” she said. “Poor Carmine, it must be so lonely and cold down the hill.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Then you won’t even fathom how it feels for me,” I said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Well, it’s not my fault you don’t sleep at your Academy loft,” Valentina said. “But I’ll give one thing to you, though—that little sister of yours is so cute I can’t blame you for taking care of her so much.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“She deserves a better childhood than I had. . . ” a certain tenderness poured out of my voice before I cut it— “ . . . she deserves a good childhood, you know?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Sylvia nods in recognition—maybe she stirs through several memories. The train’s shrill whistle is low-pitched and far beyond us. All that was left was sheets of virgin snow. The lack of footprints set us all in an uncomfortable ease, as if the smell of ozone would sift the air when we least anticipated it. </span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Romin’s hands halted at his sides. Two revolvers rested in their holsters, waiting for a snap of deliverance, which made my sword and Valentina’s knives seem unnecessary, but the Academy instructors always insisted they were right: the first to show battle scars and trade war stories. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">They’ll attack you before you know it, before you can even pull the trigger or hear their clicks or their glowing eyes,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> the instructors said, </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">and you should pray you never see what they look like, those bastards, I had to kill one after he stole my fireteam-mate’s identity, and you should pray you never see them halfway through transforming, like melted flesh, like something dead-and-alive that’s half-human and half-not, and it’s…</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> incredibly effective at scaring the young Cadets. That’s why they </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-weight:600;">paid</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> Sylvia to paint posters. I guess then I was in the transition phase, or the second stage of fear like a second puberty—right before graduation when all the uncertainty and fears came back, all the “oh Gods, what’s it really like beyond the walls?” </span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">They didn’t show us for a reason. The ambiguous and imagined will always be far more frightening than the proven. It was like Sylvia the first week after starting medical school, when she got the “Human Book Of Known Diseases” and thumbed through it in a night like one of the government’s outlawed books about the Chosen legends—when she started believing she had all those diseases, and all I could do was laugh at her.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The walk was quiet since quiet was so rare. And also from the crack of every branch. Romin sweat bullets as if he could use them as live ammunition, so he turned his big, bald, black head from his girlfriend. Valentina played stoic as if she were a renowned television celebrity, and Sylvia stayed close to me—I could see them all running in their minds from the concept of nighttime.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">If worst comes to worst, we could just stay out here in a house,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> I could say. Then they’d all just nervously nod their heads (or Valentina would be the first to sprint and cry for the next train), but as amusing as that would be, I decided not to bring it up.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The air grew colder with a bitter smell. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">They probably thought it was ozone.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Just geothermal activity in the area,” I said, “but we’re fine, we’re almost there.” While they were busy being nervous, I thumbed through Everett’s old records, mostly flooded with indiscernible scribbles and disjointed words—a single crest consistent across all of them with our family name: “Berguard.” I was young when he approached the end of his life, when the ability to sleep was stolen from him by the Chymaeran Curse. His hands trembled. His writing accelerated. He mumbled and cried about something he had forgotten, and eventually he got so scary my father Clint refused for me to see him: then eventually my stoic father was too terrified to see him.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">He died in his sleep,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> they said, but I know that was a lie. He stayed awake for a full month before he died—the autopsy says his brain dissolved to a tenth of its size. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">How could you tell it was the curse?</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> I asked. </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">Because gray matter doesn’t glow purple,</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> they said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">But it’s only the specialized Chymaerans, the Cadets say, only, like, a percent of a percent can do that, but nobody’s proven that, either. If there was some magic hundred-chamber revolver and I loaded it with a single bullet, you wouldn’t let me press it against your head and pull the trigger—neither would Romin, Sylvia, or Valentina—and would you even trust I loaded just one bullet? Confirmation bias and experience is the only reason I didn’t tremble—on the first trips before my mother Moira died, Clint told me he’d protect me no matter what, and I felt so safe.</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> </span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">But the night of my mother’s death is the reason I started protecting myself, and the reason why I’ll never forgive him—if two broken pieces could always match, then maybe Sylvia and I were perfect for each other—but damaged goods didn’t fracture the same.  I always felt we were patching spaces where our imperfections failed to meet: but in time I’d learn we just failed to muster the courage to patch the space between us.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%; font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"><br /></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The door took a full shoulder before it gave in. The hinges screeched from beyond a century of snow-borne rust as chips of pine wood tore from the bottom, leaving the door with jagged, gnashing teeth. It siphoned outside air as if the house had lungs to breathe.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Hello?” I called, just to break the silence and see if I hadn’t forgotten how to speak. The house’s siding groaned in response, breathing winds into its lungs, and a single chandelier hung from the wooden cross-beam like a uvula. Dormant lanterns circled the chains as crystalline fragments shimmered—Valentina was probably glancing at them with some reminiscence of home. There were no voices outside the walls like our apartments at the Academy, footsteps from upper floors, but even in the silence, we still felt like we were being watched.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">It felt as if some agent was consuming all the light in the house, opposite of the way that light bulbs and lanterns throw their colors. Romin dragged several matches against the floor. Three sputtered in sparks before the gravity of the scene finally weighed on us, or before our terrors could even take shape, before the manifestation of an ancient bloodbath brought itself into focus: painted across the floors as if the glass of the crimson paintings had shattered under pressure and spilled their contents.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I looked at the map, then the ground, then back to the map—in the split second my fireteam felt fear’s flame feather in their lungs, my brain sputtered.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Valentina opened her mouth to scream, how much she hated blood, but the bass in Romin’s voice beat her to it.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Gods,” he said. But that was it: his face plain and neutral as if this scene had graced him a thousand times before. “Chymaeran bastards,” he muttered several times.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">With her medical experience, Sylvia could say she owned the color red from all the cadavers she cut. Our steps clattered on the linoleum floor of the kitchen before ages-old splashes of not-ketchup flooded the floors and a sickening smell saturated the air. The bones must have been picked apart by scavengers: the meat left clean like a rib roast after a hundred starving cadets.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I threw my bag on the counter, scattering journals and notebooks and pages and artifacts—all I brought was all I inherited from my grandfather. And all across them was the same insignia, the same letter I saw etched in the doorway, the same set of strokes on the stationery that my grandfather spilled the last pieces of his mind on, the same symbol reflecting on the stone above the hearth of the fireplace, and . . .</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Valentina sunk under Romin’s arm like an afterthought as Sylvia checked the corpse: illuminated by faint beams of sunlight through the tattered shades. “I’m not trained as a mortician,” she said. “But there’s deep scratches on the vertebrae—must have been a slice to the carotid artery, and they bled out on the floor.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Romin calmly strolled across the carpet with the lantern. His fingers traced desperate scratches on the door, followed by jagged, splintered teeth around the doorknob as if someone had tried to break out: bludgeoned indentations that grew weaker and weaker. “Damn Chymaerans must have been trying to break in—the rest of the family must have been hiding in here,” he said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“But there’s no trace of Chymaeran essence along the corpse’s scratches. When Human blood and Chymaeran essence make contact, it glows purple, then leaves a dry chalk residue,” Sylvia said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“So it was Human, then?” said Valentina.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“That’s right,” I said, “Chymaeran attacks look a whole lot different.” I kept scanning through the documents and notebooks, all signed with the same cursive letter at the bottom.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“By Gods, this wasn’t Chymaeran at all, look at the marks,” she said. Tiny handprints. Like handprints of a desperate child: then the size of the clawed scratchings all made sense. The notes grew no more intelligible: further and further until I got to the bottom, to the map that sprawled across the table. And the necklace Sylvia found on the corpse had the same insignia: the letter B</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">We had been using this map for years. All the houses, all the terrain other explorers hadn’t charted, beyond the walls, beyond the eye’s reach of the train tracks, all the creases and folds that had been left to my grandfather’s memories, and all those X’es had been circling around one location: the desperation of Everett’s brainless scratchings reaching a crescendo, as if all his cerebral emotions of some long-passed moment had bled in warning. That this map wasn’t for treasure.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“This was Everett’s house,” I said, just as Romin’s kick bludgeoned the door into a shower of splinters. The rancid odor of death only grew stronger, but besides the blood of the corpse and the scratchings on the door, upturned furniture, and shattered glass all across the carpet, there was nothing else: wildlife and nature had picked the entire scene clean.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">But not the locked room, some kind of study, which held Romin and Valentina in curiosity, glowing in the dying western light as if it had been preserved so perfectly in amber. Romin asked what kind of coward would leave a child outside to die: but no corpses of children turned up in any corner of the house, no matter how hard we scanned. Our time was running short. This wasn’t a murder mystery, after all, but a Frostpunk loot run, and as the sun descended, it cast its final rays on all the reflective surfaces—metallic items, jewelry, black-font forbidden books, and the four of us loaded  sleds in haste.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Silence swept over us for nearly an hour until Romin’s voice severed it, something had been bothering him. “They weren’t protecting themselves,” he called, “it just doesn’t make sense. It had to have been something else.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“What do you mean?” Sylvia asked.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Un-shattered glass in the study, the windows still intact, all locked in the down position—you see this door locks from the inside, and it was locked.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Okay,” I said.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“So if the door was locked, why did they stay in the room?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">He began to fervently scan the study, but the sun was setting, already past the pine trees, setting the entire room in a fading afterglow. “We have to get home,” I said. “Remember the schedule?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“Most days I work in ‘repo’ with the Carmine, Titus. Nobody hides anything from us or </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">me</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">,” Romin said. “Come on, this far, and we’re off with chump change?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I grumbled under my breath. “Fine.”</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I laughed. “Ridiculous, we’re wasting daylight, there’s not a…”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">The carpet folded backwards in the corner. Dusk caught one last reflection off the rectangular lid of an aluminum tin, then my fingers fondled for an edge until I lifted it from the hollowed crevice.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">I shook it: something heavy inside emitted a certain curious energy, but that curiosity faded with the darkness, replaced with the anxiety of almost an hour behind. Romin ogled the box with the words </span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt; font-style:italic;">I told you.</span><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;"> His anticipation jumped when his huge ogre hands couldn’t tear the lock from the box, then he angrily tossed it on the sled.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">“That better damn well be worth an hour,” I said, taking a final glance over my shoulder. The shattered teeth of the door siphoned snowflakes: we had abused and thrown around its innards for long enough, and all that remained was a single body, whose death held no gravity—at least in the moment.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Sylvia found a fire axe in the train car. Valentina voiced her concerns it would damage the inside—but Romin was mid-swing, and all we saw was the spray of sparks illumine the box before his hands emerged from the twisted metal. The moonless night brought no radiance beyond the fire in the train car. Scraps of aged vellum lined the box, legible aged vellum, legible aged vellum and a full word at the bottom that was indiscernible in the darkness.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; line-height:109%;"><span style=" font-family:'Palatino Linotype'; font-size:13pt;">Romin’s hands held two strands of sliver that swung with the weight of a pendant. It glowed the faintest crimson, and it was in that moment I should have known the significance of the artifact that sat for decades waiting to reach my hands.
